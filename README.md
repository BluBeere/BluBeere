- 👋 Hi, I’m BluBerry
- 👀 I’m interested in Coding
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on A Unity-like website thats easier to understand and free (for now. I might need to set prices so that I can host it on a public domain that isnt GitHub. It would be like $1.50 a month though so no worries there hopefully.
- 📫 How to reach me: Send me a message through GitHub
- 😄 Pronouns: He, Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Penguins and Axalotls are my favorite animals
